# Instructions

Before starting the server, you need to first spin up MongoDB in a separate Docker container. To do this, run the command in the project directory. (You should have Docker installed on your computer before.)
```
docker-compose up -d
```
 


For running server in dev mode use command 
```
npm run dev
```
